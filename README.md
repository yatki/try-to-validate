# Try to Validate
> A simple function to validate if nested object properties exist.

## Why

### 1. Avoid writing long if conditions for object properties
When you have to deal with big objects which have nested properties, you always have to properly check if the property exits.

So probably you will end up a code like below:

```javascript
if (me && me.x && me.x.y && me.x.y.z === 'something') {
  // hopefully come here without any exception
}
```

Otherwise you may get `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'y' of undefined` or `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'z' of null` exceptions.

### 2. Avoid passing inner object path as string

There is a few popular work arounds for this proplem actually. You can pass object and giving property path as a string or you can extend Object via prototype like here: 
See: [JS object has property deep check](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33444711/js-object-has-property-deep-check/33445095#33445095): 

However, when you pass inner object path as string you can't use your IDE's autocomplete support. 

## Installation

```
npm install try-to-validate --save
```

or

```
yarn add try-to-validate
```

## Usage
```javascript
import tryToValidate from 'try-to-validate';

const me = {x: {y: {z: "I'm here"}}};

if (tryToValidate(() => me.x.y.z)) {
  // you can safely call all properties.
  console.log("This is going to work", me.x.y.z);
}

if (tryToValidate(() => me.a.b.c)) {
  // Can't access here
} else {
  console.log("It's going to enter this block.");
  console.log("Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'b' of undefined");
}
```

If you don't prefer to use ES6 for a reason, you can use the syntax below:

```javascript
var tryToValidate = require('try-to-validate');

var me = {x: {y: {z: "I'm here"}}};

if (tryToValidate(function() { return me.x.y.z})) {
  // you can safely call all properties.
  console.log("This is going to work", me.x.y.z);
}

if (tryToValidate(function() { return me.a.b.c})) {
  // Can't access here
} else {
  console.log("It's going to enter this block.");
  console.log("Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'b' of undefined");
}
```

## How it works

Javascript objects are evaluated on runtime. So if you return your object statement in a callback function, that statement is not going to be evaluated until callback function is invoked.

So this function just wraps the callback function inside a try catch statement. If it catches the exception returns false.

## Performance

When it comes to performance please note that extending object via prototype approach is 10x times faster than using try/catch blocks.

```
try/catch average: 0.006678999999999928
prototype average: 0.0007430000000000064
try/catch average: 0.006343999999999778
prototype average: 0.0005649999999998499
try/catch average: 0.006257999999999845
prototype average: 0.0005689999999998349
try/catch average: 0.006386000000000012
prototype average: 0.0005769999999998618
```

I'm currently looking for a way to improve these results. Any contribution is welcome :) 

## TL,DR;

```javascript
'use strict';
module.exports = function(cb) {
  try {
    return cb();
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
};
```

## Warnings 

- Be careful when you use `this` inside `arrow functions`! See: [http://es6-features.org/#Lexicalthis](http://es6-features.org/#Lexicalthis)
- Don't use **exception handling** for your custom logic unless you really know what you are doing. 
This library **doesn't intend to suppress exceptions**. 
It's just for writing shorter conditions when you need to compare objects.
