# Try to Validate
> A simple function to validate if nested object properties exist.

## Why

### 1. Avoid writing long if conditions for object properties
When you have to deal with big objects which have nested properties, you always have to properly check if the property exits.

So probably you will end up a code like below:

```javascript
if (me && me.x && me.x.y && me.x.y.z === 'something') {
  // hopefully come here without any exception
}
```

Otherwise you may get `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'y' of undefined` or `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'z' of null` exceptions.

### 2. Avoid passing inner object path as string

There is a few popular work arounds for this proplem actually. You can pass object and giving property path as a string or you can extend Object via prototype like here: 
See the topic: [JS object has property deep check](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33444711/js-object-has-property-deep-check/33445095#33445095) 

However, when you pass inner object path as string you can't use your IDE's autocomplete support. 

## Installation

```
npm install try-to-validate --save
```

or

```
yarn add try-to-validate
```

## Usage
```javascript
import tryToValidate from 'try-to-validate';

const me = {x: {y: {z: "I'm here"}}};

if (tryToValidate(() => me.x.y.z)) {
  // you can safely call all properties.
  console.log("This is going to work", me.x.y.z);
}

if (tryToValidate(() => me.a.b.c)) {
  // Can't access here
} else {
  console.log("It's going to enter this block.");
  console.log("Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'b' of undefined");
}
```

If you don't prefer to use ES6 for a reason, you can use the syntax below:

```javascript
var tryToValidate = require('try-to-validate');

var me = {x: {y: {z: "I'm here"}}};

if (tryToValidate(function() { return me.x.y.z})) {
  // you can safely call all properties.
  console.log("This is going to work", me.x.y.z);
}

if (tryToValidate(function() { return me.a.b.c})) {
  // Can't access here
} else {
  console.log("It's going to enter this block.");
  console.log("Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'b' of undefined");
}
```

## How it works

Javascript objects are evaluated on runtime. So if you return your object statement in a callback function, that statement is not going to be evaluated until callback function is invoked.

So this function just wraps the callback function inside a try catch statement. If it catches the exception returns false.

## Performance

When it comes to performance, it's hard to say which approach is better. 

On my tests **if the object properties exist and the statement is successful** I noticed using try/catch is **faster** than spliting string to keys and checking if keys exist in the object.

But if the property doesn't exist at some point, prototype approach returns the result faster.

See the test yourself: [https://jsfiddle.net/yatki/382qoy13/2/](https://jsfiddle.net/yatki/382qoy13/2/) 

```

prototype average on failed match: 0.000776000000000181
```

So both solutions have their disadvantages and advantages depending on your logic. 

Let's say, you know you'll have the properties most of the time in your response object from api. However, you want to validate if properties exist (just in case for not breaking the app), then using this function can be more useful. 

I'm currently looking for a way to improve these results. Any contribution is welcome :) 

## TL;DR

```javascript
'use strict';
module.exports = function(cb) {
  try {
    return cb();
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
};
```

## Warnings 

- Be careful when you use `this` inside `arrow functions`. See: [http://es6-features.org/#Lexicalthis](http://es6-features.org/#Lexicalthis)
- Don't use **exception handling** for your custom logic unless you really know what you are doing. 
This library **doesn't intend to suppress exceptions**. 
It's just for writing shorter conditions when you need to compare objects.
