# Validate Object Props
> A simple function to validate if nested object properties exist.

## Why

When you have to deal with big objects which have nested properties, you always have to properly check if the property exits.

So probably you will end up a code like below:

```javascript
if (me && me.x && me.x.y && me.x.y.z === 'something') {
  // hopefully come here without any exception
}
```

Otherwise you may get `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'y' of undefined` or `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'z' of null` exceptions.

## Installation

```
npm install validate-object-props --save
```

or

```
yarn add validate-object-props
```

## Usage
```javascript
import validateObjectProps from 'validate-object-props';

const me = {x: {y: {z: "I'm here"}}};

if (validateObjectProps(() => me.x.y.z)) {
  // you can safely call all properties.
  console.log("This is going to work", me.x.y.z);
}

if (validateObjectProps(() => me.a.b.c)) {
  console.log("This is not going to work since a doesn't exists");
} 
```

If you don't prefer to use ES6 for a reason, you can use the syntax below:

```javascript
var validateObjectProps = require('validate-object-props');

var me = {x: {y: {z: "I'm here"}}};

if (validateObjectProps(function() { return me.x.y.z})) {
  // you can safely call all properties.
  console.log("This is going to work", me.x.y.z);
}

if (validateObjectProps(function() { return me.a.b.c})) {
  console.log("This is not going to work since a doesn't exists");
} 
```

## How it works

Javascript objects are evaluated on runtime. So if you return your object statement in a callback function, that statement is not going to be evaluated until callback function is invoked.

So this function just wraps the callback function inside a try catch statement. If it catches the exception returns false.

TL,DR;

```javascript
exports.validateObjectProps = function(cb) {
  try {
    return cb();
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
};
```
